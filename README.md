Brief Description of Project - Travel Agency and Tour Planning is a multilingual travel and tour management software that helps organizations to manage operations related to reservations, ticketing, customer check-ins, payment processing, and more on a centralized platform. It enables staff members to create and organize excursions with details, such as location, category, texts, images, standard expenses, and pickups.
A travel agency can guide you and save you money. They also ensure that travelers will have the correct travel documents, so they do not end up missing their plane or cruise. And when things do go wrong, travel agents have the resources and the contacts to get travelers to the head of the line.
